## What is Continues Delivery?
* 🔵 Continues delivery is the state your software is in, if it is in deployable state in frequent smaller cycles then you are doing continues delivery.
* 🔵 Continuous delivery (CD or CDE) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, without doing so manually. (wikipedia)
  * It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.
  * The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production.
  * A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.
* 🔵 Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time. (martin fowler)
